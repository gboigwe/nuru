## 🎪 Judge Q&A Prep

### **"How is this different from existing payment apps?"**
*"Traditional apps require typing complex addresses. Nuru lets you say 'Send money to mama' using ENS names. It's voice-first for Africa's mobile-first population."*

### **"Does the voice recognition actually work?"**  
*"We've integrated OpenAI Whisper API optimized for African English accents and crypto terminology. This demo simulates the full flow - the real version processes actual speech."*

### **"What's your go-to-market strategy?"**
*"Ghana first, Nigeria next. Partner with mobile money operators and leverage existing remittance corridors. Voice UI reduces friction for non-technical users."*

### **"How do you handle security?"**
*"ENS provides human-readable verification. Social verification via EFP. Voice receipts on Filecoin create immutable audit trails. Users confirm before any transaction."*

### **"What's next after the hackathon?"**
*"Deploy to Base mainnet, integrate with real ENS names, partner with African mobile operators, and scale across West Africa's $50B remittance market."*

## 🎬 Demo Commands (Practice These)

### **Opening Hook**
*"Imagine your grandmother in Ghana wants to send money to her grandchild studying in Nigeria. Instead of complex crypto addresses, she just says..."*

### **Voice Command Examples**
- *"Send 50 cedis to mama.family.eth"* ← **Use this as primary demo**
- *"Transfer 100 USDC to friend.eth"*
- *"Pay kofi.ghana.eth 25 dollars"*

### **Closing Statement**
*"Nuru lights up payments by making crypto remittances as natural as conversation. We're not just building an app - we're bridging the voice-first habits of Africa with the financial future of crypto."*
