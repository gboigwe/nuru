# Voice-to-Crypto Remittance MVP: Complete Development Guide for Claude Code

## 🎯 PROJECT MISSION

**Project Name**: VoicePay Africa  
**Tagline**: "Speak Money, Send Money - Crypto Remittances Made Simple"

**Core Problem**: Cross-border remittances are expensive, complex, and require technical knowledge that excludes millions of Africans from participating in the global economy.

**Solution**: Voice-powered crypto remittances using ENS names, where users simply say "Send 50 cedis to mama.family.eth" to execute blockchain transactions.

**Target Bounties**: ENS ($2,000), Base ($1,500), EFP ($200), Buidl Guidl ($500), FileCoin ($500) = **$4,700 potential**

## 🎯 CORE RULES FOR CLAUDE CODE

### Rule 1: MVP-First Mentality
- Build working functionality over perfect code
- Every feature must demonstrate bounty requirements
- Focus on demo-ready features that judges can see working
- No over-engineering - simple, functional solutions only

### Rule 2: Bounty-Driven Development
- ENS integration is CORE - not an afterthought
- Every major function must showcase blockchain capabilities
- Document how each feature meets bounty criteria
- Build features in order of bounty value (ENS > Base > others)

### Rule 3: User Experience Priority
- Mobile-first design (80% of Ghana uses mobile)
- Voice commands in simple English first, local languages later
- Clear error messages and user feedback
- Minimize wallet complexity for users

### Rule 4: Technical Constraints
- Use only free-tier APIs and services
- All code must run on testnet during development
- Keep external dependencies minimal and reliable
- Build for demo conditions (reliable internet, controlled environment)

### Demo Risks
- **Internet connectivity**: Prepare offline demo video
- **Mobile device issues**: Test on multiple devices
- **API key exhaustion**: Monitor usage throughout development
- **Smart contract bugs**: Deploy and test early

### Presentation Risks
