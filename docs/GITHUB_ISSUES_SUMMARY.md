## 🚀 Recommended Order for Sequential Development

If you want to work on these yourself in order:

1. **Start with #2** - Package Migration (easiest, sets foundation)
2. **Then #3** - Core Provider Setup (builds on #2)
3. **Then #4** - Wallet Connectors (needs #3)
4. **Then #5** - UI Components (needs #3, #4)
5. **Finally #6** - Testing & Docs (validates everything)

### Parallel Development Option:

Can be done simultaneously by different contributors:
- **Track 1:** #2 → #3 → #4 (Backend/Config)
- **Track 2:** #2 → #5 (Frontend/UI)
- **Track 3:** #6 (Documentation - can start early)
